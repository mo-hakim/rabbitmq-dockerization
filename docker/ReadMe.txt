Errors 
Ran into playwright error when attaching rabbitmq to cleverbot as the host system weas missing dependcies to run browsers with several missing libraries.
This led to Cleverbot exiting with code 0.
Tried to install dependencies seperately but another error. This could be due to playwright supporting images that are based on Ubuntu OS but this code is in Debian.
